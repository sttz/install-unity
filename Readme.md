# Introduction

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/sttz/install-unity/releases). install-unity is a self-contained executable and has no dependencies.

Or you can install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using [sttz/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/sttz/homebrew-tap), see the tap readme for instructions.

Installing the latest release version of Unity is as simple as:

    install-unity install f

# How to build plugin on Windows

```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained --framework net6.0
```

## Versions

Most commands take a version as input, either to select the version to install or to filter the output.

You can be as specific as you like, `2018.2.2f1`, `2018.2.2`, `2018.2`, `2018`, `f` or `2018.3b` are all valid version inputs.

`install-unity` will scan for the available regular releases as well as the latest betas and alphas.

    install-unity list
    install-unity list a
    install-unity list 2019.1

Will show the available versions and the argument acts as a filter. Without an argument, only regular releases are loaded and displayed. Add an argument including `b` or `a` to load and display either beta or both beta and alpha versions as well.

In case install-unity fails to discover a release, it's also possible to pass a release notes or unity hub url instead of a version to `details` and `install`:

    install-unity details https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2018.3.0
    install-unity install unityhub://2018.3.0f2/6e9a27477296
## Packages

The command above will install the default packages as specified by Unity.

    install-unity details 2018.2

Will show the available packages for a given version. You can then select the packages you want to install with the `-p` or `--packages` option. The option can either be repeated or the names separated by space or comma:

    install-unity install 2018.2 --packages Unity,Documentation
    install-unity install f -p Unity Linux iOS Android
    install-unity install 2018.3b -p Unity -p Android -p Linux

## Apple Silicon

By default, `install-unity` will download and install the Unity editor matching the current platform. 

Use `--platform macOSIntel` to download and install the Intel editor on Apple Silicon.

Use `--platform macOSArm` on Intel to download the Apple Silicon editor.

## Offline Install

install-unity can be used in a two-step process, first downloading the packages and then later installing them without needing an internet connection.

    install-unity install 2018.2 --packages all --data-path "~/Desktop/2018.2" --download

Will download all available packages to `~/Desktop/Downloads` together with the necessary package metadata.

    install-unity install 2018.2 --pacakages all --data-path "~/Destop/2018.2" --install

Will install those packages at a later time. Simply copy the folder together with the `install-unity` binary to another computer to do an offline installation there.

You can download and install only a subset of the available packages.

## Run

To select a Unity version from all the installed ones, use the run command.

    install-unity run f

Will open the latest version of Unity installed.

You can also use the path to a Unity project and install-unity will open it with the corresponding Unity version.

    install-unity run ~/Desktop/my-project

It will only open with the exact version of Unity the project is set to. You can optionally allow it to be opened with a newer patch, minor or any version:

    install-unity run --allow-newer patch ~/Desktop/my-project

You can pass [command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) along to Unity, e.g. to create a build from the command line (note the `--` to separate install-unity options from the ones passed on the Unity).

    install-unity run ~/Desktop/my-project -- -quit -batchmode -buildOSX64Player ~/Desktop/my-build

By default, Unity is started as a separate process and install-unity will exit after Unity has been launched. To wait for Unity to quit and forward Unity's log output through install-unity, use the `--child` option:

    install-unity run ~/Desktop/my-project --child -v -- -quit -batchmode -buildOSX64Player ~/Desktop/my-build

## Create

To start a basic Unity project, use the create command. The version pattern will select an installed Unity version and create a new project using it.

    install-unity create 2020.1 ~/Desktop/my-project

The project will use Unity's default setup, including packages. Alternatively, you can create a minimal project that will start with an empty Â´Packages/manifest.json`:

    install-unity create --type minimal 2020.1 ~/Desktop/my-project

### Patch Releases

With the switch to LTS versions, Unity has stopped creating patch releases for Unity 2017.3 and newer. install-unity no longer scans for patch releases but you can still install them by specifying the full version number.

    install-unity install 2017.2.3p3
